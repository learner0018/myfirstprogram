# myfirstprogram
this is my first program in this program i have used the conditionals in python, it is the number guessing Game.
in this Game the computer system will guess a random number between 0-100 you have to predict it by input the your guess if it will match to the number it will show that you got  the right guess but if you give different input it will guide you for next input by it's too high if prediction is greater number, it will give outcome of it's too low if the number if smaller then the guess number.
